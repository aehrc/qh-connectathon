# Track 2 — FHIR for Services

**Provider Directory & Workflow · FHIR in Queensland Health Connectathon · 29–30 October 2026**

This track focuses on interoperability services and integration patterns — how FHIR-based
services are discovered, requested, coordinated and tracked across systems.

Example topics:

* Provider Directory
* FHIR Workflow
* Service discovery
* Cross-system integration

## Flagship scenario

**Radiology Referral with Directory Discovery and Booking.** An end-to-end workflow where a
referrer discovers a suitable imaging service in the Health Connect Provider Directory (HCPD),
raises a FHIR referral (ServiceRequest + Task with supporting information), and books an
appointment against slots the imaging provider publishes — with the referral status tracked
through a Task until the appointment is confirmed.

The scenario exercises AU Core, AU eRequesting, the QH referrals IG, HCPD/provider-directory
search, and FHIR R4 scheduling (Schedule/Slot/Appointment), split into a **browser core** path
and a **developer deep-dive** stream.

## Building the slides

The kick-off deck is authored in [Marp](https://marp.app/) Markdown with PlantUML-rendered
diagrams. Build it from the `slides/` directory:

```bash
cd slides
make            # render diagrams + build the editable PPTX
make preview    # per-slide PNG previews in build/preview/
make pdf        # PDF export
make help       # list targets
```

Requires `marp`, `plantuml` (+ Java, Graphviz), Chromium, and LibreOffice — all present on the
CSIRO dev image. Edit `Track2-KickOff-Deck.md` (and the `slides/diagrams/*.puml`) and re-run `make`.

## Implementation Guide

The FHIR profiles for this scenario live in a separate repository,
[**aehrc/radiology-referral**](https://github.com/aehrc/radiology-referral) — the *Radiology
Referral and Booking IG* (Connected Test Scenario 1). It builds on **AU eRequesting 1.0.1**,
AU Core 2.0.0 and AU Base 6.0.0, and profiles the Referral ServiceRequest, Referral Task,
Booking Schedule/Slot, and Referral Appointment used throughout the scenario and slides.

It is included here as a **git submodule** at [`ig/`](ig/), tracking its `main` branch:

```bash
# first checkout
git submodule update --init --recursive

# pull the latest IG from its default branch
git submodule update --remote 2026-10-29/1-FHIR-For-Services/ig
```

## Reference client — Patient-Referral

The **Referrer** role in the scenario is implemented by **Patient-Referral**
([mjosborne1/Patient-Referral](https://github.com/mjosborne1/Patient-Referral)), a Flask app
built for **Sparked Connected Testing Scenario 1 (eRequest/eReferral)** — the same scenario
lineage as our IG. The live instance runs at **https://patient-referral.onrender.com/** and is
already pointed at HCPD.

It covers most of our flow out of the box:

| Scenario step | Patient-Referral feature |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Discover (search HCPD) | Provider Directory search (name / suburb / postcode / service type) |
| Create referral | AU eRequesting `ServiceRequest` bundle from search to submission; SNOMED CT indication via Ontoserver |
| Filler triage | Filler / Specialist view — Task inbox for the receiving specialist |
| Track this request | Task status lifecycle |

It gives the **browser-core stream** a real UI (discover → refer → track) while the developer
deep-dive drives the FHIR API directly. It also renders any FHIR bundle as a Mermaid diagram —
useful for teaching. See the open `track:services` issues for the integration gaps still to
close (booking/scheduling step, target FHIR server, IG conformance).

## Keeping SharePoint and GitHub in sync

`scripts/sync-sharepoint-github.sh` syncs this Track 2 content between the SharePoint document
library (via `shit`) and this repository (via `git`). The sync is directional:

- **pull** — SharePoint → GitHub: refresh shared working materials (the `Daniel Joern Guy Paul
  Michael O/` folder) into the repo and commit.
- **push** — GitHub → SharePoint: publish the human-readable deliverables (README, AGENTS,
  scenario, agenda, time plan, recap, and the kick-off deck `.md` + `.pptx`) back to the library
  so the wider team can see them. Source/build material (`slides/`, `scripts/`, the `ig/`
  submodule) stays in git only.

```bash
cd scripts
./sync-sharepoint-github.sh              # dry-run of both directions (no writes)
./sync-sharepoint-github.sh pull --apply # refresh repo from SharePoint & commit
./sync-sharepoint-github.sh push --apply -m "Publish Track 2 updates"
```

Because `shit push` writes versions to a **shared** SharePoint library, the script defaults to
**dry-run**; pass `--apply` to make changes. Paths are configurable via the `SHIT_REPO` and
`GIT_REPO` environment variables.

## Event schedule (Track 2 blocks)

Times are fixed by the official event program (DRAFT); Track 2 content fills the track sessions.

**Day 1 — Thu 29 Oct:** kick-off & environment (11:30–13:00) → discovery (14:00–15:00) →
referral creation (15:30–17:00).

**Day 2 — Fri 30 Oct:** filler triage & availability (9:30–10:30) → booking (11:00–12:30) →
status tracking + stretch (13:30–15:00) → Show and Tell demo (15:30–16:30).

See the concrete time plan for the full mapping including plenaries and breaks.

## Status & how to contribute

Work is tracked via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aehrc/qh-connectathon/issues):

* **Planning tasks** (#1–#3) — scenario review, group feedback, stakeholder engagement.
* **Pre-event dependencies** (#8–#11) — HCPD access, directory↔referral-server linkage,
  QH referrals IG version, and 2026 FHIR server URLs. These must resolve before 29 Oct or the
  corresponding schedule blocks cannot run.

Draft content lives here in the repository; SharePoint is used for broader checkpoints and
visibility. Contributions and review via pull request and issues are welcome.
